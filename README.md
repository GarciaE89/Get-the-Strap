For this weeks homework we were tasked with creating a responsive design that ensures a web application renders well on a variety of devices and window screens. 
Directions
First, you will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:


Create the following files files: index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.


Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items:


A navbar


A responsive layout


Responsive images




The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.


Screenshots are provided as a reference in the Assets/Images folder. Your app does not need to be exactly like the images. Use Bootstrap to create a similar, responsive layout.
